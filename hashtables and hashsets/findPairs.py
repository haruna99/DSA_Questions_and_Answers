'''
You are given two lists of integers, arr1 and arr2, and a target integer value, target. Your task is to find all pairs of numbers (one from arr1 and one from arr2) whose sum equals target.

Write a function called find_pairs that takes in three arguments: arr1, arr2, and target, and returns a list of all such pairs.

Input

Your function should take in the following inputs:

arr1: a list of integers

arr2: a list of integers

target: an integer


Output

Your function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers from arr1 and arr2 that add up to target.
