'''
You are given a list of n integers and a non-negative integer k.

Your task is to write a function called rotate that takes the list of integers and an integer k as input and rotates the list to the right by k steps.

The function should modify the input list in-place, and you should not return anything.

Constraints:

Each element of the input list is an integer.

The integer k is non-negative.

    k = k % len(nums)  
    
    nums[:k], nums[k:] = nums[-k:], nums[:len(nums)-k]
        
    


nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
k = 3
rotate(nums, k)
print("Rotated array:", nums)

    EXPECTED OUTPUT:
    ----------------
    Rotated array: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
